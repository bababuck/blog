Welcome to my page! A little about me, I'm a Design Verification Engineer at Aril Inc small startup focussed on RISCV processors. I enjoy working at the interface between software and hardware, but mostly just coding in general. I hope to use this blog to share my projects as well as some lessons I learned along the way.
